###########################################################################
#
#  Purpose:  This script will install a data load product that follows the
#            DLA standards.
#
#        Usage "DLAInstall  [-d -n -x]"
#
#          where
#              -d is an option that tells the script that this is a
#                 development installation, so less restrictive permissions
#                 should be used than if it was in production.
#              -n is an option that tells the script that it does not need
#                 to verify the set of directories that are required by
#                 most loads (FILEDIR, INPUTDIR, OUTPUTDIR, etc).
#              -x is an option that tells the script to exclude the build
#                 step even if it finds a build.xml file.
#
#  Env Vars:  None
#
#  Inputs:  None
#   
#  Outputs:  None
#
#  Exit Codes:
#
#      0 = Successful completion
#      1 = An error occurred
#
#  Assumes: 
#      - The calling script has set up the environment.The INSTALLDIR 
#        environment variable is set to define where the load is being installed
#      - DLA standards are being followed for environment variable names
