To create a new job stream shell script:

1) Make a copy of JobStreamTemplate.sh
2) Replace each instance of LOADNAME with the name of the load.
   This will establish the actual name of the shell script,
   config file and log file.
3) Replace LOADNAME_APP with the environment variable from the
   configuration file that holds the path of the Java application.
4) Add any other logic to the shell script that is needed for the
   specific load.
